# Optimization-of-Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm
Overview:

This project aims to optimize the Floyd Warshall Algorithm allowing the computation of the all pair shortest paths in comparatively less time.
Implementation of different algorithms like the sequential algorithm, rectangular algorithm and parallel implementation of the blocked Flyod Warshall Algorithm have been analyzed to observe which takes the least time.

Features:
